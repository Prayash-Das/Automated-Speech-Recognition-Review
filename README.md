# Automated Speech Recognition - Review Paper

![ASR](pic.png)

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This repository contains a review paper on **Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)**, exploring its challenges, methodologies, and key algorithms used in virtual assistants like **Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa**.

### ðŸ“Œ Abstract
Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) has become an essential part of virtual assistants, enabling hands-free interactions. However, ASR systems still suffer from **high error rates**, misinterpretations, and difficulties in handling accents, noise, and pronunciation variations. This paper discusses:
- The accuracy challenges in ASR.
- The **Word Error Rate (WER)** formula.
- Methods to enhance recognition, including **Hidden Markov Models, Neural Networks, and N-grams**.
